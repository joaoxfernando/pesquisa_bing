# Pesquisa Bing / Bing Search

This project will automatically perform searches on Bing to collect Microsoft Rewards Points to redeem for gift cards or another rewards.

The survey will take around 3 minutes to complete and will complete the 30 daily surveys (desktop).

Just run the script, leave it running and go do something else while it runs

At the end it will show the **rewards panel** so you can get some extra points
